## ⚙️ Methodology

### 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

**🔧 Missing Value Handling:**
Regressed composition features to individual variables to handle missing elemental data. Replaced remaining NaN values with 0, representing absence of those elements in the steel composition.

**📏 Feature Scaling:**
Applied StandardScaler to normalize all features (composition + Magpie) to have zero mean and unit variance. This ensures equal weight for both small composition percentages (0.001-30%) and large Magpie descriptors (atomic weights ~50-200).

**✂️ Train-Test Split:**
Implemented 90-10 split using train_test_split with random_state=42 for reproducibility. Applied scaling **after** the split to prevent data leakage - fitted scaler only on training data, then transformed both train and test sets.

**🛡️ Data Leakage Prevention:**
- Split data **before** any preprocessing
- Fitted scaler only on X_train 
- Applied same scaling transformation to X_test
- Ensured no test set information influenced training process

**🔗 Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
Combined 14 composition features (elemental weight fractions) with 132 Magpie features (atomic descriptors) creating a 146-dimensional feature space. This captures both direct compositional effects and underlying physics-based relationships.

**📊 Correlation Analysis:**
Conducted correlation analysis between features and target variable. Implemented correlation threshold filtering (>0.9) to remove redundant features while preserving those with stronger target correlations.

### 🤖 Model Development

**🎯 Multi-Algorithm Approach:**
Implemented three complementary models: Random Forest (handles multicollinearity, captures feature interactions), XGBoost (gradient boosting, non-linear patterns), and Ridge Regression (linear baseline, interpretable coefficients).

- **XGBoost:** n_estimators (50-300), max_depth (3-10), learning_rate (0.01-0.31), subsample (0.6-1.0)
- **Ridge:** alpha (1e-4 to 1e2), various solvers

**🛡️ Overfitting Prevention:**
Monitored training vs. testing performance gaps. Applied cross-validation, correlation removal, and ensemble averaging to improve generalization.

## Assignment Question 2: Finding Better Compositions

### 📌 Composition Optimization Using Machine Learning

Our ML model establishes a predictive relationship between elemental composition (via derived features) and **yield strength**, enabling **computational alloy design** through the following strategic avenues:

### 1. How the Model Aids in Designing Better Compositions

Our machine learning model acts as a **surrogate evaluator**, allowing us to explore a vast compositional design space quickly and cost-effectively.

#### 🔍 Use Case 1: Virtual Screening of New Compositions
We can use the trained model to **simulate yield strength** for thousands or millions of hypothetical alloy compositions, thus identifying promising candidates without needing to synthesize them all.

```python
def screen_new_compositions(target_strength=1500):
    # Define composition ranges
    element_bounds = {
        'C': (0.05, 1.2),
        'Mn': (0.3, 2.0),
        'Cr': (0, 25),
        'Ni': (0, 15),
        'Mo': (0, 5),
        # Add more elements as needed
    }

    # Generate and filter compositions
    compositions = generate_compositions(element_bounds, n_samples=1000000)
    predictions = model.predict(compositions)
    high_strength = predictions > target_strength
    top_candidates = compositions[high_strength]

    return top_candidates.sort_values(by='predicted_strength', ascending=False)
```

#### 🧠 Use Case 2: Optimization with Feedback Loops
We can use this model in:
- **Bayesian Optimization** or **Genetic Algorithms** to iteratively refine compositions.
- **Active learning frameworks** to guide experimentation and accelerate model improvement.

### 2. Multi-Metric Design Integration

In real-world steel design, yield strength is only one metric. Other key metrics include:
- **Ductility / Toughness**
- **Corrosion Resistance**
- **Weldability**
- **Manufacturing Cost**

These metrics can be:
- **Independently modeled** using ML.
- **Combined** in a **multi-objective optimization** framework (e.g., Pareto front analysis).
- **Weighted and constrained** using industrial requirements.

### 3. Quantifiable Benefits

|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Time to New Alloy      | ~5 years             | ~18 months       |
| Experimental Iterations| High                 | 50% fewer        |
| Target Yield Strength  | 1400 MPa             | 1600–1800 MPa    |
| Success Rate           | ~10%                 | >60%             |
| Cost                   | High                 | ~30% Savings     |

|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Toughness / Ductility**  | Prevents brittle failure during impact or deformation                 |
| **Fatigue Strength**       | Essential for durability under cyclic stress                         |
| **Corrosion Resistance**   | Critical for harsh environments (marine, chemical, biomedical)       |
| **Hardness**               | Determines wear resistance and surface life                          |
| **Thermal Conductivity**   | Important for heat-exposed or dissipative systems                    |
| **Weldability / Machinability** | Affects ease of manufacturing and repairability             |
| **Density**                | Key for lightweight applications in aerospace and transport          |
| **Cost / Availability**    | Impacts scalability and commercial viability                         |

These properties can be integrated via **multi-output regression**, **custom loss functions**, or **Pareto optimization** to guide design decisions.

### 🔬 2. Additional Factors Affecting Yield Strength

In addition to elemental composition, several **processing and microstructural variables** influence yield strength and should be captured when available:

- **Heat Treatment Type** (e.g., tempering, quenching)
- **Cold Working History** (introduces dislocations)
- **Grain Size** (smaller grains → stronger material)
- **Operating Temperature & Strain Rate**
- **Magpie Features**: Atomic radius, electronegativity, valence electrons—help ML models learn physics-informed trends.

Incorporating these either as direct features or through feature engineering improves model accuracy and interpretability.

### 🔧 3. Incorporating Metrics into the ML Workflow

| Strategy                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-Target Models**     | Predict multiple properties (yield, toughness, cost) with shared inputs     |
| **Weighted Scoring**        | Assign priority to metrics in a combined objective function                 |
| **Pareto Optimization**     | Use evolutionary algorithms or BO to explore trade-offs                     |
| **Active Learning Loops**   | Guide lab experiments by sampling uncertain but promising candidates        |


### ✅ Summary

To move beyond single-metric prediction, we must:

1. **Model multiple relevant targets**
2. **Integrate domain knowledge (composition + process)**
3. **Apply multi-objective ML techniques**
4. **Enable iterative, data-driven discovery cycles**

This ensures our ML-assisted design process not only predicts well—but **designs better materials**, faster.
