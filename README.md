## Feature Engineering

### 1. Composition Features
Direct weight percentages of alloying elements in steel compositions.

### 2. Magpie Features
Physics-based descriptors including:
- **Atomic Properties**: Atomic number, atomic weight, atomic radius
- **Electronic Properties**: Valence electrons, electronegativity
- **Thermodynamic Properties**: Melting temperature, density
- **Statistical Descriptors**: Mean, standard deviation, range, mode for each property

- **Correlation Removal**: Eliminated highly correlated features (threshold > 0.9) while preserving predictive power
- **Combined Approach**: Merged composition and Magpie features for comprehensive modeling

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

**Feature Integration and Scaling:**
Applied StandardScaler normalization to handle the wide range of feature magnitudes, from small elemental weight percentages (0.001-30%) to large Magpie descriptors (atomic weights ~50-200). The standardization ensures equal contribution from both composition features and physics-based Magpie features during model training.

**Dataset Partitioning:**
Implemented 80-20 train-test split with stratified sampling based on yield strength ranges to maintain representative distributions across strength levels. This approach preserves the natural distribution of steel grades from structural (1000-1500 MPa) to ultra-high strength (>2000 MPa) categories in both training and testing sets.

**Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
Combined 15 composition features (elemental weight fractions) with 117 Magpie features (atomic descriptors) to create a comprehensive 132-dimensional feature space. This dual-representation captures both direct compositional effects and underlying physics-based relationships, enabling the model to learn both explicit alloying effects and implicit atomic-level interactions.

**Correlation-Based Feature Analysis:**
Conducted systematic correlation analysis between all features and the target variable to identify the most predictive relationships. Implemented correlation threshold filtering (>0.9) to remove highly redundant features while preserving those with stronger target correlations, reducing dimensionality from 132 to approximately 89 features for some model variants.

### Model Development

**Multi-Algorithm Ensemble Approach:**
Developed three complementary modeling strategies: Random Forest for handling multicollinearity and feature interactions, XGBoost for gradient boosting efficiency and non-linear pattern capture, and Ridge Regression for linear baseline comparison and coefficient interpretability. This multi-algorithm approach ensures robust performance across different data patterns and provides cross-validation of results.

**Hyperparameter Optimization Framework:**
Implemented RandomizedSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation for systematic hyperparameter tuning. The search spaces covered critical parameters: Random Forest (n_estimators: 50-300, max_depth: None/10/20/30, min_samples_split: 2-6, min_samples_leaf: 1-4) and XGBoost (n_estimators: 50-300, max_depth: 3-10, learning_rate: 0.01-0.31, subsample: 0.6-1.0). The 5-fold cross-validation ensures stable performance estimates while preventing overfitting to specific data partitions.

**Feature Importance Integration:**
Incorporated Random Forest feature importance analysis to validate domain knowledge and identify critical predictive features. This approach provides interpretable rankings that align with materials science principles, confirming the importance of carbon content, chromium additions, and atomic weight distributions for yield strength prediction.

**Overfitting Mitigation Strategy:**
Monitored training vs. testing performance gaps throughout model development to identify overfitting tendencies. Applied multiple regularization approaches including cross-validation during hyperparameter selection, feature correlation removal, and ensemble averaging to improve generalization performance.

### Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Performance Metrics:**
Selected R² (coefficient of determination) as the primary metric for explaining variance in yield strength predictions, essential for materials scientists to understand model reliability. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) provides interpretable error measurements in MPa units, allowing direct assessment of prediction accuracy relative to typical steel strength ranges (±123 MPa represents ~8-12% relative error).

**Complementary Error Assessments:**
Incorporated MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for robust error estimation less sensitive to outliers, particularly important given the presence of ultra-high strength steels (>2000 MPa) that could skew RMSE calculations. The combination of RMSE and MAE provides comprehensive error characterization for both typical and extreme steel compositions.

**Cross-Validation Performance Analysis:**
Implemented 5-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and generalization capability across different data subsets. This approach reveals performance consistency and identifies potential overfitting issues, crucial for the limited dataset size (312 samples) relative to feature dimensionality (132 features).

**Materials-Specific Validation:**
Evaluated predictions against known metallurgical principles and composition-property relationships to ensure physically meaningful results. Feature importance rankings and prediction patterns are validated against established strengthening mechanisms (solid solution, precipitation, grain refinement) to confirm model reliability for materials design applications.

    composition_ranges = {
        'C': (0.05, 1.2),    # Carbon: 0.05-1.2%
        'Mn': (0.3, 2.0),    # Manganese: 0.3-2.0%
        'Cr': (0.0, 25.0),   # Chromium: 0-25%

        # ... other elements
    }
    
    # Constraints: sum to reasonable total, realistic combinations
    candidates = generate_compositions(composition_ranges, n_samples=1000000)
    predictions = model.predict(candidates)
    
    # Filter high-strength candidates
    high_strength_indices = predictions > target_strength_min
    promising_compositions = candidates[high_strength_indices]

The weights are balanced: 40% atomic score, 40% strength score, and 20% cost score, targeting aerospace frames, automotive body panels, and sports equipment.

**Multi-Scale Objective Function:**
The optimization process predicts atomic descriptors from composition, scores atomic design targets based on application requirements (maximize, minimize, or range optimization), predicts macroscopic properties, then combines scores using application-specific weights to find optimal compositions.
