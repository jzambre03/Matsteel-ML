# Pre-Interview Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your:
- skills in AI-ML
- understanding of the role of AI-ML in materials engineering.
Before the Interview:
1. Create and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts a single performance metric from design parameters.
    - You may use the provided [matbench_steel dataset](#dataset-info) or a dataset of your own choice. 
    - Use Python and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Provide written answers to the questions
    - Explain how your model could be used to help find a composition with a better performance metric value?
    - What additional metrics could be considered when creating a better design and how can additional metrics be incorporated in the ML-assisted design process?

During the Interview:
1. You will be given 20 minutes to explain your approach to the interview team and 10 minutes for questions on the assignment.
    - you may show the Jupyter Notebook and/or other materials during your explanation
    - keep in mind the assignment goals 
    - your audience will include both experts in AI-ML and non-experts.
